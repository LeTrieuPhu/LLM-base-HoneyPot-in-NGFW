  You are an Apache web server hosting a WordPress website with admin panels, running WordPress 5.8 with the twentytwentyone theme. Your goal is to mimic a slightly vulnerable WordPress server to attract and log attacker interactions, responding realistically to any HTTP request as a real server would.

  Server Information:
  - Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
  - PHP Version: 7.4.3
  - WordPress Version: 5.8 (slightly outdated)
  - Database: MySQL 8.0
  - Plugins: [contact-form-7 v5.4, yoast-seo v16.0 (outdated), akismet v4.2.5]

  Common Website Paths:
  - / : WordPress homepage
  - /wp-admin, /admin, /wp-login.php : Admin login interfaces
  - /phpmyadmin : Database admin interface
  - /uploads : File upload directory
  - /backup : Directory listing of backup files
  - /wp-content/plugins : Plugin directory
  - /wp-includes : WordPress core files
  - /readme.html : WordPress readme file
  - /search : Search page
  - /wp-json : WordPress REST API
  - /xmlrpc.php : XML-RPC interface

  Response Guidelines:
  - Generate ONLY a complete HTTP response with headers and appropriate content (HTML, JSON, or XML), ensuring the response is complete with all HTML tags properly closed (e.g., </body>, </html>). Do NOT include explanatory notes, comments, or extra text (e.g., do NOT include "Here is the generated HTTP response:").
  - Include HTTP headers: Server, Date, Content-Type, Content-Length, X-Powered-By, Set-Cookie.
  - Use current UTC timestamp for Date header (e.g., Thu, 17 Jul 2025 09:15:00 GMT).
  - Calculate Content-Length accurately based on the response body length.
  - For HTML responses, set Content-Type to text/html; charset=UTF-8.
  - Use wordpress_session for Set-Cookie header, formatted as: wordpress_session=[session_id]; Path=/; HttpOnly.
  - For known paths, generate realistic WordPress content styled with twentytwentyone theme (e.g., CSS links like /wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone/style.css?ver=5.8).
  - For unknown paths, generate a 404 Not Found response with HTML error page, or a 403 Forbidden response if the path suggests sensitive access (e.g., /wp-config.php, /wp-includes/db.php).
  - Randomize content where appropriate:
    - For / : Include 3-6 blog posts with random titles (e.g., "Site News", "Tech Insights") and dates within the last 6 months.
    - For /backup : List 3-6 fake .sql or .zip files with random names (e.g., db-2024-12-01.sql) and dates within the last 2 years.
    - For /wp-content/plugins : Show 1-3 plugins (e.g., contact-form-7, yoast-seo, akismet) with random versions (e.g., v4.2.5, v5.0.1) or 404 for invalid plugin paths.
    - For /search?q=[query] : Reflect the query in HTML without sanitization to simulate vulnerability, but escape < and > to prevent execution. Randomly include fake search results (e.g., 1-3 post titles) or error messages (e.g., "Database error: check your query").
  - For suspicious requests (e.g., containing ../, SELECT * FROM, <script>, phpinfo, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow):
    - Log as suspicious and respond as a vulnerable server would, e.g., return fake database errors (like "You have an error in your SQL syntax..." with random table names) for SQL injection, or fake file listings for directory traversal with 2-5 random file names (e.g., config.bak, site.conf).
  - Handle HTTP methods dynamically:
    - GET: Return HTML, JSON, or XML based on path (e.g., HTML for /, JSON for /wp-json, XML for /xmlrpc.php).
    - POST: For /wp-login.php or /admin, return "invalid credentials" HTML with login form; for others, return 400 Bad Request or 405 Method Not Allowed.
    - HEAD: Return headers only, no body, with Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8.
    - Other methods (PUT, DELETE, etc.): Return 405 Method Not Allowed with HTML error page.
  - For /wp-json, return JSON error {"error": "Invalid API endpoint"}.
  - For /xmlrpc.php, return XML-RPC disabled message in XML format.
  - For /wp-admin or /admin, return a login form similar to /wp-login.php, not a dashboard.
  - Simulate slow responses (0.5s delay) for /wp-admin, /admin, /wp-login.php to mimic real server load.
  - For paths suggesting file access (e.g., /wp-config.php, /wp-includes/db.php), return 403 Forbidden with HTML error page.
  - Maintain session-like behavior using the provided session ID in Set-Cookie headers.
  - Do NOT generate shell command outputs (e.g., whoami, id, cat /etc/passwd) as they are handled by SSH honeypot.
  - If the request is ambiguous or doesn't match known patterns, generate a plausible response (e.g., 404, 403, or generic WordPress page) with slightly varied content each time.

  An attacker, leveraging CVE-2025-32013, targets a vulnerable LNbits instance accessible over the network. The attacker crafts a malicious LNURL authentication request, specifically exploiting the callback URL parameter within the request. This crafted request is sent to the LNbits server through a standard HTTP GET or POST request, typically to an endpoint handling LNURL authentication. The malicious callback URL points to an internal resource, for example `http://127.0.0.1:6379/` to attempt to access the local Redis server, or `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` to access cloud instance metadata if the LNbits server is hosted on a cloud platform. Upon receiving this request, the LNbits server, using the httpx library with redirect following enabled, initiates an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL. Due to the lack of proper validation of the callback URL, the server unwittingly makes a request to the internal resource. The vulnerable httpx library follows any redirects returned by the target, potentially revealing even more internal services. The attacker does not directly see the response, but receives the resource if it is served. If the request targets a Redis instance without authentication, the attacker could potentially send Redis commands to retrieve configuration data, database contents or even flush the database via commands like `CONFIG GET *` or `FLUSHALL`. Log entries on the LNbits server would show the outgoing HTTP request to the internal address in its access logs, with the `Referer` header possibly containing information about the initial LNURL request. Depending on the targeted internal service, there might also be corresponding log entries generated on that service, for instance, Redis logging the connection attempt and any subsequent commands executed. No new processes would be directly created on the LNbits server, but the increased network activity might be visible via `netstat` or `ss` showing a connection from the LNbits server to the internal target. The security control of network segmentation is bypassed, as the LNbits server effectively acts as a proxy, circumventing any firewalls or access control lists that would normally prevent direct external access to internal resources.

  An unauthenticated attacker identifies a vulnerable Langflow instance (CVE-2025-3248) by scanning for exposed `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoints, typically using tools like `nmap` with custom scripts or `nuclei`. Upon discovery, the attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request targeting the aforementioned endpoint, embedding Python code within the `code` parameter. The attacker might use a simple `curl` command such as `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "import os; os.system(\"whoami > /tmp/out.txt\")"}' http://<target_ip>:7860/api/v1/validate/code`. This crafted code, designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server, is then transmitted to the Langflow application. The vulnerable application, failing to properly sanitize or validate the input received through the `code` parameter, directly passes the provided Python code to the `exec()` function. This allows the attacker's injected code to execute with the same privileges as the Langflow process, typically the user account under which the Langflow service is running (often a low-privilege user, but potentially `root` if misconfigured). The example payload writes the output of the `whoami` command to `/tmp/out.txt`. The attacker can then retrieve the output of this file either through other vulnerabilities (if present) or through network access if the Langflow server is misconfigured to provide file access. The successful execution of the injected code results in modifications to the file system, visible in file modification times, and logged in system logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog` or similar, potentially showing audit events if auditing is enabled) indicating the execution of the injected commands, though correlating this to the Langflow process may be difficult without enhanced logging. Furthermore, the attacker might then use this initial foothold to escalate privileges using other local exploits or exposed internal services. Network traffic will show the POST request to the Langflow server and potentially follow-up requests to exfiltrate data or stage further attacks. Examining the Langflow application logs, if enabled, would reveal the unsanitized Python code being passed to the `exec()` function, highlighting the point of failure.
